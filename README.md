# Approach:
- I have used Context to store all the React states.

- First, I created the home page where information about the website can be found.
  - Applied the following features in the Home Page:
    - Products and vertical scroll to view the other products.
    - Used a custom component to render only selected types of products based on the props passed.
    - For example, the products on sale were loaded by passing `type` as "onSale," and the same was done for `type` as "popular."
    - Added products to the cart.
      

- After that, I created a products page named "all-products."
  - Here, a list of all products can be found.
  - Created the UI from the all-products array.
  - Implemented features:
    - "Sort by price high to low."
    - "Sort by price low to high."
    - "Sort by rating high to low."
    - "Add products to the cart."
      

- After this, I created the "Cart" page.
  - Here, all the products that were added to the cart can be found.
  - Implemented features:
    - "View cart items."
    - "Increase Product Quantity."
    - "Decrease Product Quantity."
    - "Dynamic Change in total price based on cart item."
    - "Modal for checkout and tracked the state changes into context."
    - "Model for entering user details."
    - "Mocked payment system."
    - "Resetting page on the completion of payment."
    - "Opening and closing of Modal."

**Summary of Features:**

I've corrected the capitalization, added missing punctuation, and improved the readability of the text.
